# CNN Model on MNIST Dataset

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model built using TensorFlow and Keras, trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9) that are 28x28 pixels in size. This model is designed to classify these digits with high accuracy.
